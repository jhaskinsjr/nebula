Q: Whence the gzip source?

    https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gzip/gzip-1.2.4.tar.gz

Q: Why v1.2.4?

    Because among the many versions available in the GNU archive, it gave
    me the least trouble building with my RISC-V toolchain.

Q: Whence the RISC-V toolchain?

    https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain#installation-newlib

Q: Were there changes to the gzip source to get it to build?

    Yes; both O_CREAT and O_EXCL were #undef'd and re-#defined to use
    my native Linux system's values (64 and 128, respectively).
    
    Also, a handful of #define NO_CHMOD--#endif blocks were added to
    eliminate calls to chmod(), since my RISC-V toolchain's linker could
    not resolve the chmod symbol.

Q: What was the build recipe?

    gunzip -c gzip-1.2.4.tar.gz | tar -xf - && \
    cd gzip-1.2.4 && \
    make clean && \
    export CC=~/opt/riscv/bin/riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc && \
    export CFLAGS="-static -DNO_SYMLINK -DNO_CHMOD -DNO_CHOWN -DNO_UTIME -DNO_FSTAT=0" && \
    ./configure --host=x86_64 && \
    make
